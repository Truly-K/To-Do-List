# To-Do-List
To Do List app using React
This app has a minimal style and is simple and functional. You can add an item to the list by typing it in followed by the return key. Items can be removed by clicking them. 

Future Improvements:
Rather than remove the item when it is completed, the item will move to the bottom of the list with a line through it allowing you to remember what has been completed already.
